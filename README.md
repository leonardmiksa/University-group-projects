### 1. Automated Greenhouse Climate Control (TIA Portal)

This project involved modeling, simulating, and visualizing an automated climate control system for a smart greenhouse using Siemens TIA Portal.  

**Course:** Plant and Process Automation

**Project collaborators:** Marina BraniloviÄ‡, Jazz Richard Greblo, Leonard MikÅ¡a

Key features:
- PID control of greenhouse temperature
- Control of air humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity
- Simulation of external disturbance (outside temperature) modeled by a sinusoidal generator
- Ladder Logic programming of controllers and actuators (HVAC, humidifiers, irrigation, LED lighting)
- Human-Machine Interface (HMI) design for monitoring, manual setpoint input, and alarm states
- Animation of crop ripening, harvesting, and spoilage based on environmental conditions

Tools used:
- Siemens TIA Portal
- Simatic S7-1200
- Simatic KTP700 Basic Panel

The final system was fully simulated in TIA Portal with a functional HMI and dynamic process visualization.

Notes:  
- While the system worked perfectly during laboratory simulations on a Siemens S7-1200 PLC, the implementation as designed would be heavily impractical for real-world deployment due to the control logic
- All the flaws for real-world implementation are extensively described in the project report 
- **The project remains an academic exercise in modeling, control, and automation logic development**

### 2. Room Air Temperature Control Simulation (Python)

Simulation of a room air temperature regulation process using a PID controller. This work was developed independently.

**Course:** Mechatronics Systems

Key features:
- Heating element behavior
- Room thermal capacity and losses
- Sensor behavior and external disturbances

Tools used:
- Python
- Spyder IDE

Note:  
- The project models physical behaviors realistically but simplifies aspects like anti-windup compensation for educational clarity.

### 3. Comparison of Features of Noisy and Filtered Speech Signals (Upcoming)

**Course:** Computer Speech and Language Processing

**Collaborators:** Jazz Richard Greblo, Leonard MikÅ¡a

Key features:
- Analysis of speech signals corrupted by noise
- Application of digital filtering techniques
- Comparison of extracted features (e.g., energy, zero-crossing rate, spectral properties) before and after filtering

**Note:**  
> This project is currently under development. A detailed report and results will be added here upon completion.
